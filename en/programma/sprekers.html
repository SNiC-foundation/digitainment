Rob van Kranenburg is currently working at the 'Virtual Platform'.  This platform is a Dutch policy and network organization for e-culture.  He is mainly involved with negotiability strategies of new technologies like ubicomp and RFID, at cultural and economic levels.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class='bio'><h3>Biography</h3>Rob van Kranenburg (1964) graduated cum laude in Literary Theory at Tilburg University (Nl). He went to work with Prof Ronald Soetaert in Ghent, in the Educational Department, developing online learning modules, methods and concepts drawing on the idea of multiliteracies. In 2000 he went to Amsterdam to work as a programmer on media education at the centre for culture and politics de Balie and as a teacher-coordinator of the new media program in the Film and Television Studies Department at the University of Amsterdam. Feeling it was too young a field to predominantly historize it, he moved to Doors of Perception and co-programmed with John Thackara Doors 7, Flow, the design challenge of pervasive computing. In 2003 he mentored a postgraduate course in performance, theatre and the arts at APT, Arts Performance Theatricality. For the past two years he has been working part time at Virtual Platform, Dutch policy and network organization for e-culture, as interim and now as co-director. One day is for teaching (mostly at Arts and Design Academies). As innovation consultant he is mainly involved with negotiability strategies of new technologies, predominantly ubicomp and rfid (radio frequency identification), the relationship between the formal and informal in cultural and economic policy and the requirements for a sustainable cultural economy.</div>

                    <div class='lecture'><h3>Lecture Information</h3>Narrative is a fundamental mode of human thought and expression. Narrative takes advantage of all our senses as it shapes our understanding of ourselves and of the world around us. Through the millennia, narrative has focused social identity, driven human learning, and from the earliest days framed what we now call &quot;entertainment&quot; activities. Today, rich media, ubiquitous networks, and advancing sensor technologies are transforming the way in which we are able to image ourselves, interact as a society, and explore the natural world. &nbsp;Increasingly, these technologies blur the boundaries of human endeavor, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between entertainment, work, and learning; between author and audience; or, between local and global. In this talk, I will focus on these eroding distinctions in human activity space in order to make the case that successful innovation in digital entertainment will increasingly incorporate transparent human/machine partnerships that rely on a deepened understanding of the needs and desires of our narrative soul in the context of being citizens of the world.</div>

                    <div class='lecture'><h3>Lecture Information</h3>Home fitness is serious business these days. Many people try to improve their health by exercising at home with fitness devices, yet often find it difficult to remain motivated. Equipment often ends up unused in the attic. We&rsquo;ll be presenting some concepts that seek to enhance motivation in fitnessing: a virtual environment, in which the user can be immersed, and a virtual coach, who guides the training session based on biofeedback. But nice concepts are always better if they have been tested. Therefore, we have been exploring whether the application of these concepts can help to turn home fitnessing into a more motivating experience.</div>

                    <div class='lecture'><h3>Lecture Information</h3><p>Even though in recent years research and development of humanoid robots has increased, the major topics of research generally focus on how to make a robot perform specific motions such as walking. However, walking is only one of the complicated motions humans can perform. </p>
<p>For robots to play an active role in society as our partner, they must be able to simulate precisely various kinds of human actions. Based on this consideration, we study and develop various types of robot motions such as dancing, 'Tai-chi,' and 'Noh.' Also by measuring our brain activities while we are interacting with these robots that can perform such actions, we want to show the importance of physical interactions between human and computer.</p></div>

He did research in various areas, starting with mathematical control theory, character animation and interaction in mixed realities, non-linear storytelling, formal models in game design, and aesthetics of computer games. He took his diploma and his doctoral degree in mathematics from the University of Augsburg in Germany, where he investigated controllability properties of chaotic systems. After working for some time in the industry, he spent several years at the Laboratory for Mixed Realities at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, where he got in close contact with media arts. There he was responsible for the development of a character animation system for an augmented reality environment for planning stages. He participated in numerous projects ranging from non-linear storytelling for virtual environments up to a documentary film on out-of-body experiences.

                    <div class='lecture'><h3>Lecture Information</h3><p>Computer game design and technology is an area that poses many new challenges to various scientific disciplines. It requires improved computer graphics techniques and new approached to artificial intelligence in which the notion of fun plays a prominent role. It poses important questions to human-computer interaction and to software engineering. But it also challenges liberal arts and psychology to enhance the experiences games can offer, and asks educational studies how to use gaming effectively for learning and training.

                    <div class='lecture'><h3>Lecture Information</h3>In his presentation Ed Tan will try to exemplify future trends in the entertainment industry, given the current forms of media. In the next few years we will see many new forms of entertainment. Some of these will develop across different media, while others are constrained to one type of media, such as TV or internet. This growth will place heavy demands on the distribution of media, the interfaces and the middleware. Safety and privacy issues will become more important as well. Whether these developments will take place quickly or at a slower pace is dependant upon the innovative capacity of research and the way companies are able to cope</div>
